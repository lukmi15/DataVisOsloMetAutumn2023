* Visualization of the properties in a grid view
	* Sprite in the middle
	* Properties that can be chosen by drop-down menus as branches coming from the sprite
		* Those properties being "wiggly" maybe?
	* Will probably need D3 for that
	* Size of the bubbles as the branches are proportional to each other
	* The table will have filters and sorting options (depending on the nature of the characteristic)
