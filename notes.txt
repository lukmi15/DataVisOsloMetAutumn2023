		* Create a story around that
* Create interactive (and static) maps: https://www.datawrapper.de/
	* Easy to use
* Cartography:
	* Generate Leaflet marker code: https://geojson.io/
		* This can also take tables as long as they have the columns "lat" and "lon"
	* Mymap:
		* Get a Gmaps route between 2 points
* WordPress:
	* WordPress.com won't allow me to use all features and will add ads to my page
	* WordPress.org is what we want
	* grade-a example: https://s355926.azurewebsites.net

		* Create post:
			* Full-width container
			* Make an image a background image: `<img class=bgimage />`
			* Make paragraphs go swoosh: `<p class=swoosh />`
* Visual Perception
	* The lecturer likes area as a device of comparing values
		* Those are good for overviews and when there are many data points
		* Good for comparing very small and very big values:
* Maps and narratives
	* 3-Act-Structure:
		1. Setup
			* There has to be a hook for the listener/viewer/reader
			* Introducing a spacial setup makes sense
			* Introducing characters to the story
			* Introducing background to understand later events
		2. Conflict
			* Begins with problem, confrontation, hurdle, ... that produces tension between characters, if applicable
		3. Resolution
			* Everything else is explained or resolved
	* We don't have to use a 3-act structure
	* Kinds of visualizations:
		* Static visual stories
			* Is a map with markers and frames
			* Linear guidance
		* Strategies:
			* Multiple small maps
			* One big map with annotations
			* ?
		* Longform infographics
			* Good for linear reading and browser scrolling
			* Long, article with embedded media to scroll through
		* Narrated animations
			* Have temporal scale (e.g. 1 year is 1 second)
		* Multimedia visual experiences
			* Same as longform infographics but with links, like on the www
		* Personalized map stories
			* Data is shown as it enters the system
		* Compilations
			* Linearity through unfolding of the events
		* Dynamic slideshows
	* We will be using: Static visual stories, longform infographics, and multimedia visual experiences
