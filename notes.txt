	* The website will be made with WordPress
	* What we will learn:
		* Cartography
		* What types of graphs to use (what they are good for and what not)
		* Searching public dbs
		* Scraping web pages
		* Data sources and source criticism
		* Statistics
		* User-friendly design (especially charts)
		* Some math
		* Effective communication with data maps and charts
		* Digital visual storytelling
		* Analyzing relevant products in the field
			//This will be an assignment
	* Tools:
		* Framework: `d3.js`
		* Google Maps
		* Leaflet
	* Time table: https://tp.educloud.no/oslomet/timeplan/timeplan.php?type=course&id[]=MOKV3500%2C1&sort=week&sem=23h
	* First assignment: 2023-09-18
		* Presentation about an example of data visualization
		* Give opinion about why it is good or bad
	* Assignment 1:
		* Due: 2023-09-18
		* Look for any visualization
		* Talk about what is good or bad
		* Try to find data sources
		* Presentation time:
			* 1 or 2 people: 5 minutes
			* 3 people: 10 minutes
	* Assignment 2:
		* Due: 2023-10-04
		* Create an interactive map with at least 3 marks
		* Published on our WordPress
		* Create a story around that
* Create interactive (and static) maps: https://www.datawrapper.de/
	* Easy to use
* Cartography:
	* Generate Leaflet marker code: https://geojson.io/
		* This can also take tables as long as they have the columns "lat" and "lon"
	* Mymap:
		* Get a Gmaps route between 2 points
* WordPress:
	* WordPress.com won't allow me to use all features and will add ads to my page
	* WordPress.org is what we want
	* grade-a example: https://s355926.azurewebsites.net
* Story layout:
	* How to install:
		* Install GeneratePress theme on WordPress
		* Install ScrollyTelling theme from lecturer's website
		* Optional: Install GenerateBlocks as WordPress plugin
		* Create post:
			* Full-width container
			* Make an image a background image: `<img class=bgimage />`
			* Make paragraphs go swoosh: `<p class=swoosh />`
* Visual Perception
	* The lecturer likes area as a device of comparing values
		* Those are good for overviews and when there are many data points
		* Good for comparing very small and very big values:
* Maps and narratives
	* 3-Act-Structure:
		1. Setup
			* There has to be a hook for the listener/viewer/reader
			* Introducing a spacial setup makes sense
			* Introducing characters to the story
			* Introducing background to understand later events
		2. Conflict
			* Begins with problem, confrontation, hurdle, ... that produces tension between characters, if applicable
		3. Resolution
			* Everything else is explained or resolved
	* We don't have to use a 3-act structure
	* Kinds of visualizations:
		* Static visual stories
			* Is a map with markers and frames
			* Linear guidance
		* Strategies:
			* Multiple small maps
			* One big map with annotations
			* ?
		* Longform infographics
			* Good for linear reading and browser scrolling
			* Long, article with embedded media to scroll through
		* Narrated animations
			* Have temporal scale (e.g. 1 year is 1 second)
		* Multimedia visual experiences
			* Same as longform infographics but with links, like on the www
		* Personalized map stories
			* Data is shown as it enters the system
		* Compilations
			* Linearity through unfolding of the events
		* Dynamic slideshows
	* We will be using: Static visual stories, longform infographics, and multimedia visual experiences
* How to lie with charts:
	1. Poorly designed charts
		* Different ordinate scales for the respective data series in the graph
		* Visual distortions:
			* 3D perspective
			* Not having the base line at 0
				* Makes values look smaller
				* Makes changes look more dramatic
				* Somewhat accepted with line graphs
			* Scale
			* Having the base line at 0
				* If the values are high and the change is small, changes are hardly visible
				> Depends on the matter of the topic whether or not to have the base line at 0
			* Skipping values on an axis
		* Coloring
			* Inaccurate
			* Colors have meanings that can affect the graphic:
				* Red or black is danger
				* Green is good
				* Blue is cool
				* ...
	2. Showing bad data
