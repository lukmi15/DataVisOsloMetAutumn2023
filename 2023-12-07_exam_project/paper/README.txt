HOW TO VIEW THE visualizations THAT CHATGTP GENERATED?

Open the files
* `oai1.html`,
* `oai2.html`,
* `oai3.html`,
* `oai4.html`,
* or `oai5.html` in your web browser.


HOW TO OPEN SOME OF THE OTHER FILES?

The following files are sources used to create the PDF document:
* Makefile
* reflection_paper.tex

The following files are helper scripts used to prepare files needed by the visualization (the group-assignment ZIP file is pre-prepared, no need for running these scripts):
* `pokemon_csv2json.py`
* `download+unpack.bash`

If you can't open them by double-clicking, you need to tell your operating system to open them with a text editor, because they are text files but your operating system does not know how to open them. I recommend a proper code editor such as Notepad++, but you could use the built-in text editor "Notepad", if you are using Windows, as well. To do this:
1. Open the run window by pressing the Windows key and R at the same time
2. Type in "notepad"
3. Choose "File", "Open"
4. Double, click the file you want to view
